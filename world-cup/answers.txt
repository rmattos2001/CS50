Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
0m0,031s
0m0,028s
0m0,037s
0m0,104s
0m0,654s

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 0m0,049s
